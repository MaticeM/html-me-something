                    <h2>YouTube</h2>
                    <p class="pink-paragraph">I started my YouTube channel July 7, 2017.  After putting about 5 minutes of thought into it after watching one of my brother's YouTube videos, I decided to make a channel about stuttering.  My goal of the channel was to encourage stutterers and educate non-stutterers.  Since creating the channel over 3 years ago, I have amassed nearly 30,000 subscribers.</p>

                    <h2>Book</h2>
                    <p id="purple-paragraph">Exacty one year to the date, after I released my first YouTube video, I self-published my first book. <b><em>The Product of My Selfishness: The Stutter and The Story</em></b> is an autobiography detailing my life growing up with a stutter.  I talk about my early years, going through school, graduating college and the job hunt, dating with a stutter, and much more.  At the end, each member of my family shares their point of view of my stuttering. This offers an interesting perspective: being in close proximity, but still being on the outside looking in.</p>

                    <h2>Scholarship</h2>
                    <p class="pink-paragraph">After I graduated college, it took me 3 years to get a job because of my stutter. During those 3 years, I stressed over how I'd pay back my student loan debt. Because of my experiences, I wanted to ease the financial burden of students who stutter by offering scholarships. Beginning in 2019, I gave away my first scholarship, and I have done it every year since.</p>
